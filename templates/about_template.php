			Our director: Mika Williams taught music classes serveral years from her home. She became very popular due to her passion for music and love for teaching. She started to recieve really good and dedicated students whom she cannot provide adequate services for a few hours a day from home. She decided to open a music school, that also has become quite popular within a short time.
